# React Components - PRACTICE AND INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

## React Repo

A repository filled with React components and interview question solutions.

**GOAL:** Build and practice React components, improve my TypeScript skills, and add solutions to React-related interview questions.

---

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite, React, TypeScript

Starting October 24, I’ll be using this repo to build components and answer interview questions, saving my progress for future reference.

---

## Optimizations:

I will regularly refactor and optimize components for efficiency, readability, and best practices.
I also really love the [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react), which I follow to ensure best practices.

## Lessons Learned:

React is fun! I love React! When I first learned it on Scrimba, I thought it was so cool how you can create reusable components, and JSX is so fun to write and easy to use.

This repository allows me to test what I've learned, practice my skills, and be ready for interviews. Not every solution will be perfect at first, but that’s part of the process. I’m excited to track my growth and improve along the way.
